# Action Required: Landing Page Template Platform

Manual steps that must be completed by a human. These cannot be automated.

## Before Implementation

- [ ] **Decide on animation library** - Choose between Framer Motion, CSS animations, or both. This affects package installation and implementation approach.

- [ ] **Decide on code highlighting library** - Choose between Shiki, Prism.js, or react-syntax-highlighter. Shiki provides best quality but may have larger bundle size.

- [ ] **Design review** - Review and approve the minimalistic design direction for the platform landing page before implementation begins.

## During Implementation

- [ ] **Content creation** - Write copy for platform landing page (hero text, feature descriptions, CTAs). This requires human creativity and brand voice.

- [ ] **Template content** - Write SEO-friendly content for each template landing page (headlines, descriptions, feature text). Each template needs unique, valuable content.

- [ ] **Image assets** - Create or source preview images for templates. These should be high-quality screenshots or mockups of each template.

## After Implementation

- [ ] **SEO verification** - Test meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data using tools like Google Rich Results Test and social media preview tools.

- [ ] **Accessibility audit** - Perform accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Fix any issues found.

- [ ] **Performance testing** - Test page load times, especially for template pages. Optimize if needed.

- [ ] **Cross-browser testing** - Test the platform across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure compatibility.

- [ ] **Mobile testing** - Test on actual mobile devices to ensure responsive design works correctly.
